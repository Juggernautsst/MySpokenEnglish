The animal I'd like to talk about is the cockatoo. I first saw these large, white parrots on the internet and was immediately captivated by their striking appearance and apparent intelligence. Last month I moved to Australia and finally had the chance to see them in real life; their bright plumage and expressive crest were even more impressive up close, although I was surprised by how loud their calls can be. Cockatoos are very social and curious birds — they often move in noisy flocks, use their powerful beaks to climb and manipulate objects, and sometimes mimic sounds they hear. I'm fascinated by them because of their intelligence and playful behaviour, and seeing them in person made me want to learn more about their habits and how to protect their natural habitats.

We should protect wild animals because they maintain healthy ecosystems, support human livelihoods through resources and ecotourism, and offer scientific and cultural value. Since many species are threatened by human activity, protecting wildlife is essential to preserve biodiversity and safeguard our own future.

By way of illustration, I am the one who is always more willing to protect wild animals
